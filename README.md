# zeitgeist-subsquid

[Subsquid](https://www.subsquid.io/) is used to index and provide a graphql interface on top of Zeitgeist. 

Click [here](https://processor.zeitgeist.pm/graphql) to start querying on the data available with Zeitgeist.

This is a project generated by `hydra-cli scaffold`. Types are defined  in  `schema.graphql` and the mappings in the `mappings` folder.

## Concept

The substrate events are processed in a multi-step pipeline:

    Zeitgeist Chain => Hydra Indexer => Indexer GraphQL gateway => Hydra Processor => Database => Query Node GraphQL endpoint

## Prerequisites

* Node v14x
* Docker

## Bootstrap

```bash
# The dependencies setup relies on de-duplication, use `ci` to get everything right
npm ci

# Start a postgres instance
docker-compose up db # add optional -d flag to detach from terminal

# Apply migrations related to the processor's state keeping tables
npm run processor:migrate

# Apply the project's migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Now you can start processing chain data
npm run processor:start

# The above command will block
# Open a separate terminal and launch the graphql server to query the processed data
npm run query-node:start
```

## Project structure

Hydra tools expect a certain directory layout:

* `generated` - model/server definitions created by `codegen`. Do not alter the contents of this directory manually.
* `chain` - data type definitions for chain events and extrinsics created by `typegen`.
* `mappings` - mapping module.
* `.env` - hydra tools are heavily driven by environment variables defined here or supplied by a shell.

## Development flow

If you modified `schema.graphql`:

```bash
# Run codegen to re-generate model/server files
npm run codegen

# Analyze database state and create a new migration to match generated models
npm run db:create-migration # add -n "myName" to skip the migration name prompt

# Apply the migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

You might want update the `Initial` migration instead of creating a new one (e.g. during the development phase when the production database is not yet set up). In that case it convenient to reset the database schema and start afresh:

```bash
rm db/migrations/LastUnappliedMigration.ts
npm run db:reset
npm run db:create-migration
npm run db:migrate
```

To generate new type definitions for chain events and extrinsics:

```bash
# Review typegen section of manifest.yml (https://docs.subsquid.io/hydra-typegen)

# Delete old definitions
rm -rf chain

# Run typegen tool
npm run typegen
```

## Configuration

Project's configuration is driven by environment variables, defined in `.env`,
and `manifest.yml`. For more details see https://docs.subsquid.io.

## Indexer

Running an indexer is required. The indexer can be found in the [indexer folder](./indexer).

It is recommeded to use already set up indexer if available, as new indexer typically
requires some time to catch up with interesting events.

Have a look at `./indexer/docker-compose.yml` for example of how you can set up a self-hosted version.
